1. Set up LAMP (http://fedorasolved.org/server-solutions/lamp-stack)
    port: 3306
    protocol: tcp

2. Database details:

mysqladmin -u root password tianyi
mysql -u root -p

CREATE DATABASE reimbursement_db;

ALTER DATABASE reimbursement_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET 'utf8';

USE reimbursement_db;

CREATE TABLE users
(
email VARCHAR(255),
password VARCHAR(255),
first_name VARCHAR(255),
last_name VARCHAR(255),
status INT(1)
);

// status: 0 is professor, 1 is grad student, 2 is undergrad student

INSERT INTO users VALUES ('wang103@illinois.edu', md5('tianyi'), '天意', '王', 1);

3. There are 3 main interfaces: submit, process, and check.
    'submit' is mainly used by students to submit new reimbursement.
    'process' is mainly used by professors to process reimbursement submitted
        by students.
    'check' is used by everyone to check all sort of reimburments, such as:
        submitted by me
        processed by me
        other reimbursement requests
    
    Identity will be checked before any action can be granted.

4. config.php contains sensitive information, and should be placed outside the
    public directory. It's permission should be set to something like 644.
